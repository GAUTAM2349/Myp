** Usually, I divide a project in two big moments of focus. In the first part of the project I must only think about the PROBLEM. This means that every time some idea for a solution pops-up I will write it down on a post-it and only go deeper in that when I figure out what is the real problem. The second focus is all about the SOLUTION. In this case I try to stop digging into the problem and I activate my brain to solve the challenge instead.

** Divergent thinking is creative, free-flowing, and expansive. It generates multiple ideas or solutions, emphasizing variety and originality.

** Convergent thinking is focused, logical, and linear. It aims to arrive at a single correct solution to a specific problem.
