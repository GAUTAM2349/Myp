1> Microservices :_ 
	Refers to how you structure the back-end of an application.
A microservice is an architectural style where a single application is split into multiple small services that are independently deployable and communicate over a network (typically via APIs).
Each microservice handles a specific business function, and they are typically decoupled, allowing teams to work on different services without interfering with each other.
It is a server-side architecture that focuses on how different parts of a system interact at the back end.
