In a Unix-like operating system (such as Linux), the tilde (~) symbol represents the home directory of the current user. It's a shorthand that makes it easier to refer to paths relative to your home directory.

For example:

If your username is gaut2349, your home directory might be something like /home/gaut2349.
When you see ~/Coding, it means the path is /home/gaut2349/Coding.
