	ls: Lists the contents of the current directory.
-p: Adds a / at the end of directory names.
|: Pipes the output of ls -p to the next command.
grep: Searches for text matching a pattern.
-v: Inverts the match, showing only lines that do not contain the specified pattern.
/: The pattern used to filter, which in this case excludes any entries ending with / (directories).

	Documents/  
	file.txt
