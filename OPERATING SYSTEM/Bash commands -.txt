Bash commands :-

1> ps
 -> outputs processes running

2> ps aux
 -> 'a' shows all processes , 'u' shows processes for all users and other details, 'x' shows processes that are not attached to terminal, background processes.

3> ps aux | grep .git
 -> '|' pipe symbol takes the output of the command on the left (ps aux)
	and passes it to grep.
	grep -> it filters the processes list to only show lines that 
	match the search term ahead (.git).
	*ps works both on windows and bash (not aux)

4> kill -9 <pid> - kills a process forcefully
5> kill pid  - kills gracefully

5> image name in context of command lines means  name of executable files associated with a running process.

6> BASH environment does not have full access to windows processes the way native windows commands do. It is designed to work with processes within the bash environment itself , not the broader windows system processes.
