* Don't be stressed about things u can't change. While learning , don't get stressed bcz it won't help in anyway.
	Just learn. Well not being stressed and doing work requires practice. Daily practice in small small work.
	REMEMBER best you can do for all is to learn and learn only, not FUTILE thoughts.

* IF u get them in current situation will u be happy??????????????????????????????????????????????

DON'T IGNORE THE POWER OF REPEATITION +++++++++ TYPING

2> REVISION IS LACKING IN MY SCHEDULE OTHERWISE I MIGHT BE VERY AHEAD OF WHAT I AM

1> Keep watching videos on youtube --
	You get bored because, u are indulged in things which is very common and that to a very limited extend.
	Complete all the videos with revision on internet. And try to complete all at once because u know u might

3>Shift secondary works to end part, like eating when i'm ending my works, bathing after ending work, where my schedule is actually over it just suppose i'm going to sleep so before that i can have bath or food.

2> With people comes responsibility. Our own problems never trouble us to that extent and for known not even a
   bit, but of our belongings we can't manage our emotions. So i don't want to make new relations with anyone.
   Just q/a and good behavior. The only time i feel sad  is because of my people, and i never want to see them 
   even a bit of sad.

3> Anything you are doing , will have to complete anyhow. So their is no escape or reason to ignore it.

4> Don't leave any books of your favorite publications and YouTube channels.

5> Every action should be reasoned, thought for good and bads for it.
